3.844	4.449		u=m,
4.449	5.674		%= diet,
5.674	6.139		uh,
6.139	6.930		.. quota,
6.930	8.047		% % @for @you.
8.047	8.846		(H) And,
8.846	10.047		let me get a piece of paper,
10.047	12.368		so that we can write that .. down,
12.368	15.127	>ENV:	((DESK_DRAWER))[=]=
14.550	14.936	PAIGE:	[(SNIFF)]
14.936	17.250	KRISTIN:	... The [2way we2] do= this,
15.847	16.290	PAIGE:	[2Yeah2].
17.250	18.619	KRISTIN:	... is first of all,
18.619	19.416		we make a,
19.416	20.324		a guesstimate,
20.324	21.820		.. of how many calories,
21.820	22.774		.. typically,
22.774	23.961		(H) that you would need.
23.961	25.975		D- we- we didn't do this last time did we.
25.975	26.603	PAIGE:	Hm-m[=].
26.395	26.884	KRISTIN:	[Ok]ay.
26.884	27.612		(H) Alright.
27.612	27.818		Yeah,
27.818	28.946		I think .. we were gonna wait,
28.946	29.522		until we,
29.522	31.206		.. cause you were gonna change some things maybe,
31.206	32.349		after you saw ~Doris.
32.349	32.729		So,
32.729	34.851		(H) first of all we make a good guesstimate.
34.851	36.247		Of how many calories you need.
36.247	37.533		And that's always a tough one.
37.533	37.981		Um[=,
37.862	38.420	PAIGE:	[Mhm=].
38.212	39.595	KRISTIN:	.. m=]ost women,
39.595	42.283		(H) unless you work out a l=o=t.
42.283	45.823		.. You probably <@ aren't burning much more @> than like eighteen hundred,
45.823	48.656		(H)= to [maybe=] .. two thousand calories.
46.466	47.059	PAIGE:	[Mhm].
48.656	50.036	KRISTIN:	(H)= So (Hx),
50.036	51.038		what we can do (Hx),
51.038	51.623		um,
51.623	52.453		.. (TSK) I would say,
52.453	54.845		I'm gonna go ahead and make it out about eighteen hundred.
54.845	55.872		.. Just because,
55.872	56.268		uh,
56.268	57.554		you're at a good weight,
57.554	59.363		you're about five fi=ve,
59.363	60.907		.. (H)= u=m,
60.907	64.184		... (TSK) ... %I think that would be a prudent place to,
64.184	65.250		.. to start out from.
65.250	66.483		.. I know I won't uh,
66.483	67.682		.. cause you to gain weight,
67.682	67.880		and,
67.880	69.398		.. you probably won't lose any either.
69.398	70.034		[But uh,
69.398	70.441	PAIGE:	[@@@ @]
70.034	70.922	KRISTIN:	(H)] Okay.
70.922	73.197		So we're gonna take [2eighteen2] hundred ca[3lories3]=,
71.562	72.022	PAIGE:	[2(SNIFF)2]
72.624	73.000		[3Uh h-3] --
73.197	73.907		How um,
73.907	76.350		.. how many calories do you think I'm eating now,
76.350	77.963		or can you even tell= [that],
77.577	77.943	KRISTIN:	[(TSK) (H)]
77.963	78.663	PAIGE:	from loo[2king2]?
78.383	80.324	KRISTIN:	I could do a calorie count,
80.440	80.877		um,
80.877	81.719		on that,
81.719	84.429		[.. but I'd actually need more .. amounts=].
81.719	82.397	PAIGE:	[(H) Although,
82.397	83.947		you wouldn't be able to tell,
83.947	84.638		because]=,
84.638	85.208		there's no,
85.208	86.411		% I don't write down,
86.411	87.452		like the fa=ts,
87.452	88.445		and things like that.]]></TEXT>
